(1) The Html Structure -- Template Folder
(2) THe CSS Files -- Stylesheet Folder
(3) The Images Folder
(4) The Navagation bar -- Template Folder -- nav folder
(5) Nivo slider ( Homepage gallery)

============================================================================================

(1) The HTML Structure

The theme has a layout that is fixed with 3 Columns (all found in stylesheet.css)

#column_left   (Left Column)

#column_right  (Right Column)

#content       (Center Column)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#container  (all the way down to)  #header .div10   ( Is the header)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#footer   (the footer) to change the text on the footer goto template -- common -- footer.tpl

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) The CSS fILE

Only one CSS FiLE has been used -- gimboo - stylesheet - stylesheet.css

If you want the edit a certain section of the site, find the label in the css file and scroll
down unill you find the style that needs to be edited

TIP -- Open your shopping cart in Google Chrome or Firefox, navigate to the part that you want 
editing (exactly navigate with cursor) then right click on mouse and scroll down and click inspect
element, there you will find all the information that you need to find the right style, image etc
and the location that it may be found in

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(3) The Image File

All images for your template can be found in the image file

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(4) The Navagation bar - Template -- nav 

images and CSS files can be found in the above.
To modify the navigation bar text goto - template - common -
header.tpl. There scroll down to <!-- Menu Starts  --> under there you will see the appropriate text
to edit ie: Acoount, Checkout etc

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(5) The homepage gallery files are all located in gimboo/template/theme/common/home.tpl

Home.tpl is the only file hat you need to modify 

scroll down and you will see the code below

	 <img src="slide1.jpg" alt="" title="This is an example of a caption"/>
	 <img src="slide2.jpg" alt="" title="This is an example of a caption">
	  <img src="slide3.jpg" alt="" title="This is an example of a caption" />
	  <img src="slide4.jpg" alt=""title="This is an example of a caption" />

There you will see the image names ie: slide1.jpg etc etc

To add another image just paste this <img src="slide5.jpg" alt="" /> directly underneath the <img src="slide4.jpg" alt="" />

You can see all that I have change is the name of the image to slide5.jpg

So now you will have 5 slides so just repeat this or delete them depending on what you need (easy)

Ok now you need to add the image to your site 
	
	
Ok first place your new image on your desktop and name it slide5.jpg if the extension is png, gif etc make sure you change this here <img src="slide5.png" >
	
You will now have to add the new image to gimboo/nivoslider (all images for the gallery go in here) IMPORTANT!
	
Next if you want a caption underneath the image locate this code again

	 <img src="slide1.jpg" alt="" title="This is an example of a caption"/>
	 <img src="slide2.jpg" alt="" title="This is an example of a caption">
	  <img src="slide3.jpg" alt="" title="This is an example of a caption" />
	  <img src="slide4.jpg" alt=""title="This is an example of a caption" />

	And change This is an example of a caption to whatever you want or just delete if you don’t want a caption


Next you may change the speed that the image changes with this code


effect:'random', //Specify sets like: 'fold,fade,sliceDown'
        slices:20,
        animSpeed:1000, //Slide transition speed
        pauseTime:1000,
        startSlide:0, //Set starting Slide (0 index)
        directionNav:true, //Next & Prev
        directionNavHide:true, //Only show on hover
        controlNav:true, //1,2,3...
        controlNavThumbs:false, //Use thumbnails for Control Nav
        controlNavThumbsFromRel:false, //Use image rel for thumbs
        controlNavThumbsSearch: '.jpg', //Replace this with...
        controlNavThumbsReplace: 'bullets.png', //...this in thumb Image src
        keyboardNav:true, //Use left & right arrows
        pauseOnHover:true, //Stop animation while hovering
        manualAdvance:false, //Force manual transitions
        captionOpacity:0.8, //Universal caption opacity
        beforeChange: function(){},
        afterChange: function(){},
        slideshowEnd: function(){}, //Triggers after all slides have been shown
        lastSlide: function(){}, //Triggers when last slide is shown
        afterLoad: function(){} //Triggers when slider has loaded


Its quite simple, also more wxplanations can be found at http://nivo.dev7studios.com/#usage

Ps make sure your images are 960px wide & 275px height
